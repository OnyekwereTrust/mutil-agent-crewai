# mutil-agent-crewai
A simple multi-agent project to showcase CrewAI.

This repo demonstrates how to orchestrate multiple LLM-powered agents with CrewAI to analyze a startup idea from two angles:

Marketing Research Analyst → market demand, target audience, competitors, positioning.

Business Consultant → business model, pricing, revenue streams, SWOT & risks.

The project runs tasks sequentially so the business analysis can build on the market insights
